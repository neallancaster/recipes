10 oz ground turkey, divided into two patties
4 Tbsp teriyaki sauce
2 slices fresh pineapple
2 thick slices red onion
2 whole-wheat buns (we like Martin's), toasted
0.5 jalapeño, sliced thin
2 slices Swiss cheese

Cook the turkey, basting with the teriyaki sauce as you go. While the burgers cook, grill the pineapple and onion until lightly charred. Put each burger on a bun and layer on onion, pineapple, jalapeño, and cheese; top with more sauce.
